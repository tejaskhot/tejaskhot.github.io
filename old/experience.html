                [Joint first author] <b>Making the V in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in Visual Question Answering</b><br>
                <font color="red"><i>Accepted as a poster at CVPR 2017</i></font><br>
                We propose to counter language priors in the dataset for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs.<br>
                Our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair also provides a counter-example based explanation - specifically, it identifies an image that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.<br>

        <p class="content">Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network (DeSTIN) is a scalable deep learning architecture that relies on a combination of
               unsupervised learning and Bayesian inference. The paper <a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/BICA2009.pdf">
              DeSTIN: A Scalable Deep Learning Architecture with Application to High-Dimensional Robust Pattern Recognition</a> by
              <i>Itamar Arel, Derek Rose,</i> and <i>Robert Coop</i> describes this method.
              Briefly put, DeSTIN uses online clustering algorithms to hierarchically create cetroids in a way that loosely mimics the
              way humans understand things. In the DeSTIN architecture a hierarchy of layers is used, where each layer consists of
              multiple instantiations of an identical circuit or node which follow a defined spatial orientation for imaging
              applications (generally speaking, however, the spatial relationship can vary according to the problem domain).
              Each node learns to generalize and represent a temporal sequence of observations through unsupervised learning.
              I implemented a new flavor of DeSTIN based on Stacked Convolutional Auto-encoders and tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
              datasets achieving a 21% improvement in accuracy and 6x speedup in computation time over the previous architecture.<br>
