  <!-- <p class="content"> My ongoing research can be broadly classified into two categories: 1) Learning parsimonious semantic representations of 3D scenes captured as point clouds. Combining the expressive power of deep learning as a function approximator with geometric priors to capture the inherent structure present in the point clouds is a very important step towards full 3D scene understanding. I am particularly interested in the cognitive phenomena of perceptual organization and grouping. 2) Learning behaviors for robot agents in 3D environments using deep reinforcement learning. I am interested in exploring the emergence of intelligent behavior from raw sensorimotor data and its multi-modal associations with memory, perception and action. </p> -->

  <p class="content">I am interested in pursuing research at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and robotics. My long term goal is to build intelligent robots that can <i>perceive</i> the world and <i>interact</i> with it seamlessly. I envision these robots to operate like scientists: observe, hypothesize, test, learn. This calls for learning actionable representations of the environment. Crucially, for such learning to scale, robots need to be endowed with mechanisms for self improvement i.e. learning without supervision. I want to design algorithms that can enable robots to predict, synthesize and make decisions from disparate streams of information, and adapt to a changing environment.

Combining the expressive power of deep learning as a function approximator with geometric priors to capture the inherent structure present in the point clouds is a very important step towards full 3D scene understanding. I am particularly interested in the cognitive phenomena of perceptual organization and grouping. 2) Tackling long-standing problems in computer vision with deep learning using only geometric consistency as self-supervision. My main focus has been on 3D reconstruction from multiple images without the onerous requirement of human supplied 3D supervision. </p>

  <p class="content">Prior to joining CMU, I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> at Virgina Tech. My work focused at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, specifically the task of Visual Question Answering(VQA). Earlier, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, India. I have been fortunate to have gotten an opportunity to work with fantastic people throughout my academic journey and I hope to continue the same.</p>
