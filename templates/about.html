  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p class="content">I completed my Bachelors from <a href="http://mu.ac.in/portal/">University of Mumbai, India</a>,
  majoring in Computer Engineering. I am interested in the research areas of machine learning (deep learning) and multi-modal artificial intelligence, particularly as applied to computer vision and natural language processing, and want to explore their relevance in a wider Robotics context. I am particularly interested in understanding the cognitive abilities of humans with regards perception which encompasses several closely tied areas of study. I want to study how intelligence emerges from raw data and its multi-modal associations with memory,
  perception and action. Embodied Cognition hypothesis, the idea that cognition is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself, has long excited me. At some point in my academic career I wish to explore these and some of the other larger
  goals of Artificial Intelligence.

  Since July 2016, I am working as a Research Scholar with <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> who lead the
  <a target="_blank" href="https://mlp.ece.vt.edu/">Machine Learning and Perception Lab</a> and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/CVL.html">Computer Vision Lab</a>
  respectively at <b>Virgina Tech</b> [<i> Update Aug 2016 : My advisors have moved to Georgia Tech and are currently spending a year at Facebook AI Research as Visiting Researchers</i>].
  For complex tasks such as <a href="http://visualqa.org/">Visual Question Answering</a>,
  language provides a strong prior that can often result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models
  truly understanding the visual content. My current research focuses on addressing this bias and on ways to improve
  the grounding of concepts from language and visuals.</p>
