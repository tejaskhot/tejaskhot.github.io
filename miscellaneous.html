          <p><i> Advisors : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/academic/nagarjuna-g/nagarjuna-g">Dr. Nagarjuna G (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), </a>Prof. Brijmohan Daga</i></p><br>
          <p class="content">Embodied cognition, the idea that the mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind, is
              one of the more counterintuitive ideas in cognitive science. The embodied cognition hypothesis is the idea that cognition
              is mediated by representations expressed in the vocabulary and format of sensory and motor representations. The core of the
              embodied cognition hypothesis is the claim that the format of cognitive representations is modality-specific and not abstract
              or amodal. The question that implicitly drives most research and discussion is: Why is the sensorimotor system activated
              during tasks that do not overtly require sensorimotor processing? As a part of this exploratory thesis, taking the approach of
              epigenetic robotics, we propose that cognitive process is linked with motor actions and is proprioceptive. According to this model,
              there is no unconscious perception and all seeing is seeing as and cause of perception is conscious action. We show, via
              simulations, how fundamental components of vision such as edge detection, depth perception and relative placement of objects in
              a scene can be solved with minimal computation in the presence of motor actions.

        <p class="content">I was selected to attend MLSS with full scholarship. This was a fun intoduction to some very diverse topics in Machine Learning. 
              A lot of the material was new to me and it was
              nice to learn about some advanced topics like Submodular Functions, Selective Inference, Concentration Inequalities, Stochastic
              Optimization and the like.

              I was selected to attend, with scholarship, the 2015 LPS series on <i>Markov chains: Mixing time, cover time, and rate of escape</i> by <i>Yuval Peres, Microsoft Research,
              Redmond</i>. This was a good mathematical extension to the limited material usually taught about Markov Chains in ML courses.

        <p class="content">A week of DIY hacking as a part of the <i>Smart Textiles</i> track. I worked on two interesting projects:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Singing Curtains</b> : Flat fabric speakers made out of embroidered highly conductive thread and neodymium magnets which can be
                embedded in any textile garment.</li>
                <li><b>Fabric moisture sensor</b> : One of its kind fabric moisture sensor which detects wetness of fabric and wirelessly transmits
                messages indicating moisture content. It not only detects moisture but also measures it.</li>
