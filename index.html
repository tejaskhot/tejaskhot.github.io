                    I completed my Bachelors from <a href="http://mu.ac.in/portal/">University of Mumbai, India</a>,
                    majoring in Computer Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning,
                    Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in understanding the
                    cognitive abilities of humans with regards perception which encompasses several closely tied areas of
                    study. Many breakthroughs in deep learning, such as dropout and attention to name a few, have been inspired by their biological
                    counterparts. I want to study how intelligence emerges from raw data and its multi-modal associations with memory,
                    perception and action. At some point in my academic career I wish to explore these and some of the other larger
                    goals of Artificial Intelligence.
                    <br><br>

                    Since July 2016, I am working as a Research Scholar with <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> and
                    <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> who lead the

                    respectively at <b>Virgina Tech</b> [Update Aug 2016 : My advisors have moved to Georgia Tech and are currently spending a year at Facebook AI Research as a Visiting Researchers]. 
                    For complex tasks such as <a href="http://visualqa.org/">Visual Question Answering</a>,
                    language provides a strong prior that can often result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models
                    truly understanding the visual content. My current research focuses on addressing this bias and on ways to improve
                    the grounding of concepts from language and visuals.
                    <br><br>

                    I am also collaborating with <a href="http://www.sarathchandar.in/">Sarath Chandar</a>, PhD student at

           Embodied Cognitive Robotics</b><br>

          Embodied cognition, the idea that the mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind, is
          one of the more counterintuitive ideas in cognitive science. The embodied cognition hypothesis is the idea that cognition
          is mediated by representations expressed in the vocabulary and format of sensory and motor representations. The core of the
          embodied cognition hypothesis is the claim that the format of cognitive representations is modality-specific and not abstract
          or amodal. The question that implicitly drives most research and discussion is: Why is the sensorimotor system activated
          during tasks that do not overtly require sensorimotor processing? As a part of this exploratory thesis, taking the approach of
          epigenetic robotics, we propose that cognitive process is linked with motor actions and is proprioceptive. According to this model,
          there is no unconscious perception and all seeing is seeing as and cause of perception is conscious action. We show, via
          simulations, how fundamental components of vision such as edge detection, depth perception and relative placement of objects in
          a scene can be solved with minimal computation in the presence of motor actions.

              Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network (DeSTIN) is a scalable deep learning architecture that relies on a combination of
               unsupervised learning and Bayesian inference. The paper <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/BICA2009.pdf">
              DeSTIN: A Scalable Deep Learning Architecture with Application to High-Dimensional Robust Pattern Recognition</a> by
              <i>Itamar Arel, Derek Rose,</i> and <i>Robert Coop</i> describes this method.
              Briefly put, DeSTIN uses online clustering algorithms to hierarchically create cetroids in a way that loosely mimics the
              way humans understand things. In the DeSTIN architecture a hierarchy of layers is used, where each layer consists of
              multiple instantiations of an identical circuit or node which follow a defined spatial orientation for imaging
              applications (generally speaking, however, the spatial relationship can vary according to the problem domain).
              Each node learns to generalize and represent a temporal sequence of observations through unsupervised learning.
              I implemented a new flavor of DeSTIN based on Stacked Convolutional Auto-encoders and tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
              datasets.<br>
